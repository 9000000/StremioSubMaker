**New Features:**

- **Quick Setup wizard:** Added a 6-step guided setup wizard for new users. On first visit (no saved session), an entry banner appears at the top of the config page. The wizard walks through: (1) Mode selection (Translate vs. Just Fetch), (2) Subtitle sources with optional OpenSubtitles account login for higher rate limits/VIP features, (3) Gemini API key with live validation against the Google API, (4) Language selection with searchable grid, popular language highlighting, and chip display, (5) Extras (Sub Toolbox, Season Packs, Hide SDH/HI), (6) Summary & Install with direct session creation, Stremio install link, and copy URL. Includes an "Open Advanced Settings" button that pre-fills the main config form with wizard choices for further fine-tuning. The wizard is fully standalone (`quick-setup.js`) and can be removed by deleting 4 references.

- **Expanded archive format support:** The archive extractor now handles 6 additional formats beyond ZIP and RAR: **Gzip**, **Brotli**, **7-Zip**, **Tar**, **Bzip2**, and **XZ**. Includes recursive decompression for layered archives (e.g., `.tar.gz` — Gzip layer is decompressed first, then the inner Tar is extracted). Detection uses magic bytes for all formats. Gzip and Brotli use Node.js built-in `zlib`; Tar uses `tar-stream`; 7-Zip uses `7z-iterator`. Bzip2 (`seek-bzip`) and XZ (`lzma-native`) are optional — if not installed, the addon logs a debug message and skips gracefully. The response analyzer (`analyzeResponseContent`) also detects the new formats and no longer treats Gzip as an error response.

**Bug Fixes:**

- **Fixed valid subtitles being misclassified as error responses:** The response content analyzer (`analyzeResponseContent`) checked for error keywords like "error", "failed", "denied" *before* checking if the response was a valid subtitle file. Any SRT whose dialogue contained those common English words (e.g. an episode about hacking, security, etc.) would be replaced with an error message and cached. Reordered the checks so subtitle format detection (SRT, VTT, ASS/SSA, MicroDVD, MPL2) always runs first. Also added a BOM-stripping step and a fallback timecode scan (`HH:MM:SS,ms -->`) so subtitles with unusual headers or encoding prefixes are still recognized.

- **Hardened text_error detection to reduce false positives:** Replaced the naive `includes('error')` check with word-boundary matching (`\b`) to avoid triggering on words like "terror" or "mirror". Longer responses (≥500 bytes) now require the content to *start* with an error keyword to be classified as `text_error` — a single "error" buried in a large response is no longer enough. Added additional error keywords: "unauthorized", "not found", "bad request", "service unavailable", "internal server".

- **Prevented error/informational subtitles from being cached:** The download cache (`downloadCache.saveCached`) now skips caching content that contains addon-generated error markers ("download failed:" or "informational subtitle was generated by the addon"). Previously, a misclassified error subtitle would be cached for 10 minutes and served on every subsequent request for the same file.

- **Added OpenSubtitles registration link:** The "free account" text in the OpenSubtitles Auth description now links directly to the OpenSubtitles.com registration page.

- **Fixed corrupted archive error messages showing wrong format:** `createCorruptedArchiveSubtitle()` was hardcoded to display either "ZIP" or "RAR" — any other archive type (Gzip, 7z, Tar, etc.) would show "Corrupted ZIP file". Now dynamically uses the detected archive type (e.g., "Corrupted GZIP file", "Corrupted 7Z file").

- **Fixed Gzip responses treated as errors in OpenSubtitles Auth and SubsRo:** When a provider returned Gzip-compressed content, the response analyzer classified it as `type: 'gzip'` which was then treated as an error response, showing users a "download failed" message. Removed `gzip` from the error type list since Gzip is now a properly handled archive format detected by `detectArchiveType()`.

- **Updated stale archive comments across all providers:** Removed outdated "ZIP or RAR" and "handles both ZIP and RAR" references in `opensubtitles.js`, `opensubtitles-v3.js`, `subdl.js`, and `subsource.js`. JSDoc for `isArchive()` and `readFileFromArchive()` in `archiveExtractor.js` now lists all supported formats.

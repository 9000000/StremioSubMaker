Release: SubMaker 1.1.3

## SubMaker 1.1.3

**New Features:**
- **API Key Validation**: Added "Test" buttons to validate API keys for SubSource, SubDL, OpenSubtitles, and Gemini directly from the config page
- **Dark Mode**: All addon pages now support automatic dark/light themes based on system preference with manual toggle buttons

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed config page: Gemini API key validation now properly displays notification alerts when field is empty
- Fixed config page: "Just-fetch subtitles" mode now clears validation errors for translation-only fields (Gemini API key, source/target languages)
- Fixed config page: Switching between translation and no-translation modes now clears language selections from the previous mode to prevent unwanted languages from being saved
- Various minor  fixes.
